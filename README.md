# üåê pyxora website

This is the official website for the pyxora game engine.

## About

The website includes:
- Basic information about the engine
- Automatically generated documentation
- Code to help you get started

It is a quick overview of the engine and serve as a indroduction to the project.

## Structure

- `index.html`: A basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript main page with simple design.
- `docs/`: Contains API documentation generated using [`pdoc`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc), directly from the engine's source code.
  - The API docs are the documentation of the engine itself.
  - The documentation is automatically updated with every new release.


## Repository

This repo only contains the website files.  
To view or contribute to the pyxora engine itself, see the [pyxora repository](https://github.com/pyxora/pyxora).
